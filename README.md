# Angular 2 and TypeScript Workshop

The Angular 2 and TypeScript workshop is a full day workshop 
written and presented by [@JeremyLikness](https://twitter.com/JeremyLikness) for [Connect.Tech 2016](http://connect-js.com). 
The workshop leverages cross-platform solutions so  developers on any of the major (Windows, Linux, and OSX) platforms
can take advantage of it. Prior knowledge and experience with web applications and JavaScript 
is highly recommended to get the most out of the workshop. It is designed to benefit 
users who have no Angular exposure as well as those familiar with Angular 1.x. Successful 
installation of the prerequisites is important to complete prior to the workshop to 
ensure the best possible experience (this will help minimize any potential issues with Wi-Fi availability and bandwidth). 

## Pre-requisites

The following cross-platform resources will be required to participate in this workshop:

Node.js environment (LTS): [Install from this Link](https://nodejs.org/en/)
